## FAUX | This art(ist) does not exist

FAUX uses Artificial Intelligence to generate a synthetic social media post of non-existing artists, new works and their lives. The new work is generated as the image for the post. The texts may include hashtags, handles, and emojis, making them eye-catching and engaging. Simply click the button to generate a text in first-person and an image that fits the style of the synthetic artist. Remember, this artist does not actually exist - or does it?
