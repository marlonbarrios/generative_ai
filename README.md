I have been exploring generative AI using OpenAI API for the development of text to image application and specialy for AI powered chatbots (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and conversational interfaces using vector embeddings
I have developed fullstack apps consuming OpenAI, Replicate, langchain.js have used MidJourney, Gen-1, Gen-2 and D-ID in several projects. I have also experinece with Pinecone and Autocode.

## FAUX | This art(ist) does not exist

FAUX uses Artificial Intelligence to generate a synthetic social media post of non-existing artists, new works and their lives. The new work is generated as the image for the post. The texts may include hashtags, handles, and emojis, making them eye-catching and engaging. Simply click the button to generate a text in first-person and an image that fits the style of the synthetic artist. Remember, this artist does not actually exist - or does it?
